<h1>Youtube, The new Study Source</h1>


 <h3> Introduction </h3>
 <p> 
     Many instructors and parents still consider online streams to be a platform for 
entertainment or killing time, even nowadays. However, online platforms such as YouTube 
Channels could be promising instructional tools for students and people who have graduated 
from school a long time ago. The online resources are accessible twenty-four hours a day and 
seven days per week, so there is no time restriction limiting your learning. Besides, there is 
no space limit to inhibit you from studying; as a result, you can acquire the skills you need at 
your bed or bathroom. Also, assimilating the materials on YouTube is cost-effective, because 
most of the excellent education videos are entirely free. The most attractive feature of 
YouTube is that you can master the same topic from various instructors or YouTubers and all 
depend on your preferences. These reasons are why YouTube will replace traditional 
education methods within the next ten years (Tan, 2011).
 </p>
 
<h3>No time and space limit for studying </h3>
<p>
  If you just leave the office, do you want to spend 45 minutes or longer to take buses 
to go to classrooms at the opposite corner of downtown? The answer is “NO” for an 
exhausted worker and s/he just wants to go home to relax. Having the courses at a specific 
location discourages the students from performing their long-term study plan. Or, try to 
imagine that you have one-hour free time to gain the knowledge on a Wednesday afternoon, 
but there is no class from your academic institution at that time, meaning you will waste this 
hour to learn nothing.  
  However, the YouTube platform is completely different from traditional educational 
methods. You can lie down on the sofa at your house and use your iPad to get the information 
about astronomy. Also, if you want to know how to do the gardening effectively “during 
midnight,” you can take out your cellphone and consult the YouTube videos (Rawal, 2018).  
YOUTUBE IS A PROMISING INSTRUCTIONAL TOOL THAT WILL REPLACE TRADITIONAL EDUCATION METHODS WITHIN THE NEXT TEN YEARS          3 
 
After only a half-hour, you have acquired the basic knowledge in the field you need 
compared to that you have to drive for 30 minutes to the cram school to register a class 
(Ghasemi, 2011).  
  These advantages of YouTube learnings give us more benefits during pandemic 
lock-down now. The students ranging from elementary school to the graduate school must 
stay home to avoid spreading the infections, so they can browse different videos on the 
platform to make up for not going to schools. They can sit at the desk to grasp the materials 
including science, literature and even calculus around the world. Moreover, the students can 
arrange the schedule in a day they desire to study from the channels, like 3 hours in the 
morning, 4 hours in the afternoon and 3 hours at night (Keskin, 2018). The brand-new  
learning approach is flexible for everyone and no restriction limits your study motivation, so 
the sky is limit. 
</p>
 
<h3>A cost-effective educational application </h3>
<p>
  A series of TOEFL or GRE courses at academic institutions will cost you about two 
thousand to three thousand Canadian dollars in Asia. This amount of investment is expensive 
for some students. Also, if you want to learn how to code using different programming 
languages or you want to pass the various exams held by CISCO, an industry leader, and get 
the certificate to find the jobs, you need to pay the cram school around 20 thousand for these 
courses at Japan (Human Academy Co., 2020). As a result, for some job seekers, they have to 
save enough money and think twice before they pay the tuition. Going to traditional 
institutions to study is a considerable expenditure for both students and adults. 
  Nonetheless, you can search for the videos teaching you how to use the correct 
English grammar in ESL (English as a Second Language) courses on YouTube (Duffy, 2008).

There are at least 200 thousand videos and they are all free. You do not need to pay a penny 
to acquire the knowledge of English writing on this platform. Furthermore, if you type 
“programming” in the search bar, you are going to have a million recordings about how to 
code with various languages and the instructors teach you the technologies step by step as in 
the campus (Siraj, 2013). They are all free also. For a beginner, you do not have to pay these 
YouTubers at all and you can develop the ability after studying videos.  
  Not to mention the cost of commuting from the place you live to the building of the 
classes (Rawal, 2018). Consequently, why do not you use the YouTube channels to hone your 
skills with zero payment instead of enrolling at the traditional institutions with a massive 
cost? 
</p>
 
<h3>Assorted and abundant choices </h3>
<p>
  Last but not least, for a novice, you cannot distinguish who the best teacher is in 
this field and what kind of studying process you should take, so you choose one prestigious 
institution that may not be the best fit for us. It all depends on the luck and the learning path 
is not appropriate for the most beginners. Also, you all have the experience of having a 
famous instructor whose teaching style you hardly adapt to, but you have paid the tuition or 
registered for one term and you have no other choices to make us learn effectively as other 
peers. How should you do in this circumstance? You just stop learning most of the time 
(Lichter, 2012). 
  Notwithstanding, you are not going to face these annoying difficulties when using  
YouTube. There are over 10 billion videos on the platform. You can access more than 10  
thousand recordings for a single topic in a specific field. If you cannot understand what this  
YouTuber is talking or barely keep the pace with the teacher, you can change to another

channel to learn by one click. Besides, if the content of a series of videos is too hard or too 
easy for you, you could switch to different YouTubers and it is very easy (Rawal, 2018). 
  Because there are a huge number of channels, you must get the videos to satisfy 
your own requirements on YouTube with ease. Everyone is different and everyone’s ability is 
not the same either, so gaining the knowledge you need on YouTube is the best choice for the 
people living in the advanced world (Siraj, 2013).  
</p>
 
<h3>Conclusion </h3>
<p>
  In conclusion, from the examples and evidence above, we know why YouTube is a 
promising instructional tool that will replace traditional education methods. Nowadays, 
people are much busier than before and everyone wants to accomplish the goals effectively 
and efficiently. The learning through YouTube removes all the time and space limits as 
traditional methods have. Besides, the cost-effectiveness is the first priority when the 
customer purchases the items; as a result, the free YouTube studying is the only choice they 
desire to have. Last, extremely numerous recordings on the platform can help each individual 
acquire the suitable resources and YouTube benefits all motivated students.

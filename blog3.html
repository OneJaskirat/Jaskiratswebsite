<h1>Following Your Passion</h1>

<h3>Why Passion Is So Important</h3>
<p> enthusiasm and passion are present, people tend to be more resilient when they encounter obstacles. People who are passionate about what they do, rather than just "in it for the money," tend to be people who have more positive outlooks and able to overcome difficulty through problem-solving.
<br>
Also, the more passionate someone is about their job, the more inclined they are to work hard on self-improvement, increasing their chances of success
</p>


<h3>How to Identify</h3>

    <ul>
    <li> Remember What You Loved as a Child: Often, our truest passions emerge in childhood, only to be squelched by real life pressures. So think about what you loved long before you had to worry about your career.</li>
    
    <li> Eliminate Money from the Equation: If money were no object, what would you do? Would you travel? Spend all of your time with your children? Would you start a charitable organization to help abused women? Of course money can’t be ignored, but don’t let financial pressures dictate your choices. Your career should ultimately lead to financial security, but if financial security is the defining motivator, it’s unlikely you’ll end up doing what you love.</li>
    
    <li>  Ask Your Friends for Feedback: Sometimes you’re just not the best judge of what makes you happy. Ask the people who know you intimately when you seem the happiest and what you do the most enthusiastically. Their answers may surprise you.</li>
        
    <li> Read through a University Course Catalog: Find some quiet time and see which courses naturally interest you. What would you study if you could do it all over? What courses do you think you could teach? Which subjects scare you to death, and which ones do you find boring? Revisiting these possibilities will help point you in the direction of subjects and topics that you love.</li>
        
    <li> Identify your Professional Hero: Of everyone you know, either personally or in your extended frame of reference (from your dermatologist to Oprah), whose career would you most want to emulate? Reach out to her to learn more about how she got to where she is, or, if that’s not possible, read everything you can about her career and life. </li>
    
    <li>  Think of What You Enjoy That You Also Do Well: After you’ve done these exercises, think about what you’ve learned. Focus on the things that you both enjoy and do well—whether you have a way with animals, make a killer lemon tart, or are crazy for origami—and write them down. Then, narrow the list to the top three or four things. Keep it handy, review it often, and use it as your jumping-off point when you’re plotting your career move.</li>
    </ul>

<br>
<h3>It's Never Too Late</h3>
<p>
Most Americans are dissatisfied with their jobs. According to Gallup, 85% of employees are actively disengaged from their jobs.7﻿ The need for healthcare and a steady income are reasons that many Americans feel compelled to stay where they are. However, if there is a way for a person to navigate the financial hurdles and pursue their passion in a niche area, hard work and success might come easier than assumed. Enjoying the work you do, in some ways, is more important than having a large bank account.

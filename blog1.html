   <h1>Brains and Video Games</h1>


   <h3>Introduction</h3>
  <p> Over the span of 40 years, there is tremendous increase in the sales of video games. It is also considered that playing video games most likely violent games negatively impact upon an individual behaviour and mindset. Recent studies have shown that playing video games actually have multiple positive effects on adolescence’s behaviour and development. Video games also resulted in improvement of visuospatial cognition, helpful behaviour, social relations etc.
Contrary to the traditional belief of gaming is merely an addictive source of entertainment and wastage of time, In the contemporary world, the hectic lifecycle of people has messed up the mental well-being but the video games act as a therapy in improvement of person’s psychological, mental health and developing multiple skills.
  </p>


   <h3> Boosting Up Brains </h3>
<p>
The life of person has become this much busy that finding ways to release stress from mind is necessary, with stress full mind a person will never be able to perform his/her best. The speed of brain in decreased when it is tired than no way it will perform up to the mark. “If playing video games simply makes people happier, this seems to be a fundamental emotional benefit to consider,” (Isabela Granic, 2013). If This way to attain happiness way boost up our Brain and forget our problems is possible than plenty of Mental issues. “Recent research finding evidence of lasting positive effects of video games on basic mental processes—such as perception, attention, memory, and decision-making.” Adam Eichenbaum, Daphne Bavelier, and C. Shawn Green (2014). 
Multiple scientific and Medical research has resulted saying Playing video games increases size and competence of parts of brain which are responsible for visuospatial skills- a person’s ability to identify visual and spatial relationships among objects. Furthermore, the regions of the brain that play a role in attention are more efficient in gamers compared with non-gamers, and they require less activation to stay focused on demanding tasks. Playing video games like action games requires player’s attention for entire period of time resulting in nourished concentration and attention ability. Similarly, Simulation and puzzle games includes many rules and instructions that must be kept in mind while playing the game improving a person’s learning power

Video games has also been helpful in physical health specially when the gadgets such as Wii, Playstation Eye Toy and Xbox kinetics came in market. These all gadgets include physical efforts of an individual to play games in order to get best experience. “Study found that by just playing one hour of the Playstation eye toy or Wii, children reduced their BMI (body mass index) by 8% and their body fat by as much as 50%.” (Maddison et.al. (2012). This study cleared up a whole new way for the interventions of obesity in children and providing a treatment that not only works on it, but that the child will happily use. Thus, in conclusion physical fitness will readily benefit in the development of brain also.
Video games can also be a great way to relax our mind and release stress. “Easy and easy playable games, like Angry Birds, can improve a ones mood and make them feel happier.” By the American Psychological Association. Deeply immersive and complex video games are also therapeutic. Worries of paying bills and completing deadlines can be ignored while having a good session in video game which will eventually act stress buster. A break is always required in everyday life to get out of anxiety and nothing can be better than giving a little time to a session of video game

   <h3>Cognitive Benefits </h3>
<p>
Playing video games has been reported as giving cognitive benefits, like increased visuospatial cognition. “Video games help to improve attention, spatial cognition, and mental rotation. Positive benefits like improved mental rotation abilities and improved attention can be of great help to individuals” Chandrasekharan et. al. (2010). Paying attention in work or in studies, can be improved by improving the attention span which playing long run video games can do. The cognitive limitations such as fear of flying can be efficiently overcome by games like flight simulation. 
Multiple cognitive disorders are found getting treated of the patients who play video games, such as gamers with condition amblyopia, which cause eye to become essentially non-function, are found getting improvement in degree that eye recovered to normal or near functioning. Reduction in Impulsiveness has been treated by of the people who play Action games. Even in elders, playing video games helps in reduction in mental decline that is associated with aging.
Many games have an inspiring impact upon studies too. Various games have maths, statistics, simulations which urge children to explore more and resulting in studying in various field of interest. The games such as ‘The Sims’ includes building cities which fascinate people to learn and do in practice.  The great example of sports games can be taken in which a person has to analyse athlete’s averages and statistics to choose their teams. Shot percentages, batting averages and goals per game are all based on number-crunching and can be considered as real-life examples of applications of maths.
The job-related skills are one of the fields where gamers hold benefits than non-gamers. Several studies have found that jobs that require good hand and eye coordination, attention, excellent working memory and quick decision making are performed better by people who play games. “One correlational study, for example, demonstrated that video gamers were better than non-gamers in the ability to fly and land aerial drones and were essentially as good as trained pilots on this skill” (McKinley et al., 2011). “In an experiment, novice surgeons who were provided with experience with video games improved their performance in laparoscopic surgery compared with a control group of surgeons who did not have that experience” (Schlickum et al., 2009).

  <h3>Developing Social Skills</h3>
<p>
A stereotype is also heard often that gamers have fewer social interactions and they isolate them from society. Contrary to this stereotype 70 percent of gamers play games with their friends and millions of people worldwide participate in virtual worlds of games. Online Multiplayer games like Fortnite, Call of duty, PUBG and many more have great participation in developing social communication as players have to communicate throughout the game while playing it.
"In these virtual social communities, decisions need to be made on the fly about whom to trust, whom to reject, and how to most effectively lead a group." (Isabela Granic, American Psychologists). Eventually the players get practice to snap social judgements while playing these types of social games. The great result is seen of social interaction is with introverts, those who are less open to society. Their interaction is seen more often on virtual environment, playing games with different people even if they are completely unknown to them help make some interaction with others which is eventually give positive results. 
"Video game playing is often a collaborative leisure time activity for school-aged children, and these results indicate that children who frequently play video games may be socially cohesive with peers and integrated into the school community." (Katherine M. Keyes, 2015). The creative thinking and cooperation learned during interaction in video games at result gives beneficial result in daily routine of a children, either it is in academics or in co-curricular activities.

  <h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
In conclusion, many positive effects and several benefits came as result of playing video games. There were many believes that indicates playing games as wastage of time and decrease in brain strength, but the new studies and research has found contradicting results showing video games helping boosting up mind, creative thinking, cognitive abilities, social relations. the most important many medical issues are resolved by playing video games such as amblyopia. The main benefit that is relief from stress and anxiety. Although there exist some limitations and cons but are not enough to compete with the benefits from playing video games.
